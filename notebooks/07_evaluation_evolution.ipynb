    "# Scenario 07: AI Agent Evaluation with Azure AI Evaluation SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Use the official `azure-ai-evaluation` SDK for agent evaluation\n",
    "- Apply quality evaluators: Relevance, Coherence, Fluency, Groundedness\n",
    "- Use agent-specific evaluators: IntentResolution, TaskAdherence, ToolCallAccuracy\n",
    "- Run batch evaluations with the `evaluate()` API\n",
    "- Optionally log results to Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Completed Scenario 01 (Simple Agent + MCP)\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI deployment (gpt-4o recommended)\n",
    "- Environment variables configured (see `.env.example`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",

    "| `FluencyEvaluator` | Is response linguistically sound? | 1-5 |\n",
    "| `GroundednessEvaluator` | Is response grounded in context? | 1-5 |\n",
    "| `IntentResolutionEvaluator` | Did agent resolve user intent? | 1-5 + pass/fail |\n",
    "| `TaskAdherenceEvaluator` | Did agent complete the task? | 1-5 + pass/fail |\n",
    "| `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator` | Were tool calls appropriate? | 0-1 |"

    "In this notebook, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure AI Evaluation SDK Features\n",
    "- **Quality Evaluators**: RelevanceEvaluator, CoherenceEvaluator, FluencyEvaluator, GroundednessEvaluator\n",
    "- **Agent Evaluators**: IntentResolutionEvaluator, TaskAdherenceEvaluator, ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator\n",
    "- **Batch Evaluation**: Using `evaluate()` for efficient multi-sample evaluation\n",
    "- **Custom Evaluators**: Extending the SDK with your own evaluation logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Model Configuration**: SDK evaluators require Azure OpenAI model config\n",
    "2. **Column Mapping**: Map your data fields to evaluator parameters\n",
    "3. **Scoring**: Quality evaluators use a 1-5 scale\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**: Create custom evaluators matching the SDK pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- ✅ Use batch evaluation for large datasets\n",
    "- ✅ Combine multiple evaluators for comprehensive assessment\n",
    "- ✅ Track costs alongside quality metrics\n",
    "- ✅ Integrate with Azure AI Foundry for cloud tracking (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "- [Azure AI Evaluation SDK Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk)\n",
